**Mortgage Calculator**

**Description:** Create a responsive, user-friendly mortgage calculator app using **Vite** and **Material-UI**. The app should allow users to calculate their monthly mortgage repayments, including a detailed breakdown of principal and interest payments over time. The app should also visualize the repayment schedule through a dynamic graph.

**Features to Include:**

### Input Fields:

1. **Property Value**: A field to input the total value of the property.
    
    - Label: "Property Value"
    - Input Type: Number
    - Unit: Currency (e.g., £ or $)
2. **Amount to Borrow**: A field for the mortgage amount (loan principal).
    
    - Label: "Loan Amount"
    - Input Type: Number
    - Unit: Currency
3. **Mortgage Term (Years)**: A field for the number of years to repay the mortgage.
    
    - Label: "Mortgage Term (Years)"
    - Input Type: Number
4. **Interest Rate (%)**: A field for the annual interest rate.
    
    - Label: "Interest Rate (%)"
    - Input Type: Number

### Outputs:

1. **Monthly Repayments**: The calculated monthly repayment amount.
    
    - Display in bold and as a currency value.
2. **Repayment Breakdown**:
    
    - Show the breakdown of **principal** and **interest** components of the repayment.
3. **Graph**:
    
    - A **line graph** visualizing the change in principal and interest components over the term of the mortgage.
    - X-Axis: Time (Years)
    - Y-Axis: Payment Amount (Principal and Interest)
    - Series:
        - Principal Payments
        - Interest Payments

### Functionalities:

- Calculate the monthly repayments using the **amortization formula**.
- Dynamically update the breakdown and graph based on user input.
- Display an error if input values are invalid (e.g., negative numbers, zero, or blank fields).

**Technology Stack:**

1. **Frontend Framework**: React (via Vite)
2. **UI Library**: Material-UI
3. **Graphing Library**: `chart.js` or `recharts`

### **Steps to Build the App:**

1. **Setup Project:**
    
    - Initialize a new Vite project using React.
    - Install Material-UI and the graphing library (`chart.js` or `recharts`).
2. **Create Components:**
    
    - **InputForm**: A form for collecting user input fields with Material-UI `TextField` components.
    - **ResultsDisplay**: A section displaying the monthly repayment and breakdown.
    - **RepaymentGraph**: A chart component to display the repayment breakdown over time.
3. **Implement Logic:**
    
    - Write a function to calculate monthly repayments using the formula: M=P×r(1+r)n(1+r)n−1M = P \times \frac{r(1+r)^n}{(1+r)^n-1} Where:
        - MM = Monthly repayment
        - PP = Loan amount
        - rr = Monthly interest rate (annual rate/12\text{annual rate} / 12)
        - nn = Total number of payments (years×12\text{years} \times 12)
    - Calculate the yearly breakdown of principal and interest.
4. **Graph Implementation:**
    
    - Use `chart.js` or `recharts` to plot the principal and interest amounts for each year.
5. **Styling:**
    
    - Use Material-UI `Box`, `Card`, and `Typography` components for a clean layout.
    - Ensure the app is responsive.

### Example Output:

- **Monthly Repayment**: £1,200
- **Breakdown**:
    - Month 1: £800 Principal, £400 Interest
    - Month 2: £805 Principal, £395 Interest
    - ...
- **Graph**:
    - The graph should show the principal starting low and increasing, while interest payments decrease over time.
